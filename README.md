# YimMenu

This release is made for GTA V 1.69 b3337

A mod menu base for Grand Theft Auto V.
Strictly for educational purposes.

YimMenu is originally based of off [BigBaseV2](https://github.com/Pocakking/BigBaseV2) which was an amazing base at the time but nowadays is a bit dated.
So here I am with an up-to-date menu focusing on protecting the user from toxic modders.

## How to compile YimMenu

Read the [SETUP](https://gitlab.com/YimMenu/YimMenu/wiki/Setup-your-PC-for-YimMenu-Development) guide.

## Make your own flavour of YimMenu

Fork YimMenu and git clone that repository instead of https://gitlab.com/YimMenu/YimMenu.git

## Staying Up To Date

Pull the latest changes from this repository.

With a command line it is as easy as:

```bash
git pull
```

CMake should be handling removed / added files automatically without any user input.

If this is not the case for some reason you'll have to redo the steps in the [Making changes to the source code section of the SETUP](https://gitlab.com/YimMenu/YimMenu/wiki/Setup-your-PC-for-YimMenu-Development#making-changes-to-the-source-code).

If you are doing custom modifications to the codebase and have a fork you are on your own for staying up to date with upstream (this repository), google stuff like "merge from upstream" and learn how to use Git.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` all features that should be ran in a loop are in here sorted by category

- `services/` service files to interact and maintain stuff
- `util/` general utility functions to keep code as compact and as much in one place as possible

## Contributing

You're free to contribute to YimMenu as long as the features are useful, not overly toxic and do not contain anything money related that might get the menu targeted by Take2.
